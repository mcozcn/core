```

## Running without a signup/login screen (Public mode)

If you'd like the app to open directly without a signup or login screen and share the same data between web and mobile, see `docs/public-mode.md` for step-by-step instructions and security notes.

Note: There are two user types available in this mode: `guest` (cannot save data) and `admin`. Default admin credentials: username `mos`, password `mos07`.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain then we recommend using Netlify. Visit our docs for more details: [Custom domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)
